\maketitle
This is a demo for using the \verb@Canopy@ package in R. \verb@Canopy@ is a
statistical framework and computational procedure for identifying
subpopulations within a tumor, determining the mutation profiles of each
subpopulation, and inferring the tumor's phylogenetic history. The input to
\verb@Canopy@ are variant allele frequencies of somatic single nucleotide 
alterations (SNAs) along with allele-specific coverage ratios between the tumor
and matched normal sample for somatic copy number alterations (CNAs). These 
quantities can be directly taken from the output of existing software. 
\verb@Canopy@ provides a general mathematical framework for pooling data across
samples and sites to infer the underlying parameters. For SNAs that fall within
CNA regions, \verb@Canopy@ infers their temporal ordering and resolves their 
phase.  When there are multiple evolutionary configurations consistent with the
data, \verb@Canopy@ outputs all configurations along with their confidence.\\

Below is an example on reconstructing tumor phylogeny of a transplantable
metastasis model system derived from a heterogeneous human breast cancer
cell line MDA-MB-231. Cancer cells from the parental line MDA-MB-231 were
engrafted into mouse hosts leading to organ-specific metastasis. Mixed cell
populations (MCPs) were in vivo selected from either bone or lung metastasis
and grew into phenotypically stable and metastatically competent cancer cell
lines. The parental line as well as the MCP sublines were whole-exome sequenced 
with somatic SNAs and CNAs profiled. \verb@Canopy@ is used to infer metastatic
phylogeny.\\

\section*{2. Canopy workflow}
\subsection*{2.1 CNA and SNA input}
The input to \verb@Canopy@ are variant allele frequencies of somatic SNAs along
with allele-specific coverage ratios between the tumor and matched normal sample
for somatic CNAs. For SNAs, let the matrices $R$ and $X$ be, respectively,
the number of reads containing the mutant allele and the total number of reads
for each locus across all samples. The ratio $R/X$ is the proportion of reads
supporting the mutant allele, known as the variant allele frequency. For CNAs,
\verb@Canopy@ directly takes output from
\href{http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/43/4/e23}{Falcon}
or other allele-specific copy number estimation methods. These outputs are in
the form of estimated major and minor copy number ratios, respectively denoted
by $W^M$ and $W^m$, with their corresponding standard errors $\epsilon^M$ and
$\epsilon^m$. Matrix $Y$ specifies whether SNAs are affected by CNAs; matrix $C$
specifies whether CNA regions harbor specific CNAs (this input is only needed if
overlapping CNA events are observed).
\\\\
Below is data input from project MDA231.


<<Input>>=
library(Canopy)
data("MDA231")

projectname = MDA231$projectname ## name of project
R = MDA231$R; R ## mutant allele read depth (for SNAs)
X = MDA231$X; X ## total depth (for SNAs)
WM = MDA231$WM; WM ## observed major copy number (for CNA regions)
Wm = MDA231$Wm; Wm ## observed minor copy number (for CNA regions)
epsilonM = MDA231$epsilonM ## standard deviation of WM, pre-fixed here
epsilonm = MDA231$epsilonm ## standard deviation of Wm, pre-fixed here
## Matrix C specifices whether CNA regions harbor specific CNAs 
## only needed if overlapping CNAs are observed
C = MDA231$C; C
Y = MDA231$Y; Y ## whether SNAs are affected by CNAs

\subsection*{2.2 MCMC sampling}
\verb@Canopy@ samples in subtree space with varying number of subclones 
(denoted as $K$) by a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. A plot of
posterior likelihood (pdf format) will be generated for each subtree space and
we recommend users to refer to the plot as a sanity check for sampling 
convergence and to choose the number of burn-ins and thinning accordingly. Note
that this step can be time-consuming, especially with larger number of chains
(\verb@numchain@ specifies the number of chains with random initiations, a 
larger value of which is in favor of not getting stuck in local optima) and 
longer chains (\verb@simrun@ specifies number of iterations per chain). Jobs can
be run in parallel with different $K$'s on high-performance cluster.


<<Sampling1, eval=FALSE>>=
K = 3:6 # number of subclones
numchain = 20 # number of chains with random initiations
sampchain = canopy.sample(R = R, X = X, WM = WM, Wm = Wm, epsilonM = epsilonM, 
            epsilonm = epsilonm, C = C, Y = Y, K = K, numchain = numchain, 
            simrun = 50000, writeskip = 200, projectname = projectname,
            cell.line = TRUE, plot.likelihood = TRUE)
save.image(file = paste(projectname, '_postmcmc_image.rda',sep=''),
           compress = 'xz')
@


<<Sampling2, echo=FALSE>>=
data("MDA231_sampchain")
sampchain = MDA231_sampchain
k = 3
K = 3:6
sampchaink = MDA231_sampchain[[which(K==k)]]
@

<<Sampling3>>=
length(sampchain) ## number of subtree spaces (K=3:6)
length(sampchain[[which(K==4)]]) ## number of chains for subtree space with 4 subclones
length(sampchain[[which(K==4)]][[1]]) ## number of posterior trees in each chain
@



\subsection*{2.3 BIC for model selection}
\verb@Canopy@ uses BIC as a model selection criterion to determine to optimal
number of subclones.
<<BIC>>=
burnin = 100
thin = 10
bic = canopy.BIC(sampchain = sampchain, projectname = projectname, K = K,
               numchain = numchain, burnin = burnin, thin = thin, pdf = FALSE)
optK = K[which.max(bic)]

    clikelihood[numi,i] = sampchaink[[numi]][[i]]$likelihood

\subsection*{2.4 Posterior evaluation of sampled trees}

\verb@Canopy@ then runs a posterior evaluation of all sampled trees by MCMC. If
modes of posterior probabilities (second column of \verb@config.summary@)
aren't obvious, check if the algorithm has converged (and run sampling longer
if not).


<<Post>>=
post = canopy.post(sampchain = sampchain, projectname = projectname, K = K,
                 numchain = numchain, burnin = burnin, thin = thin, optK = optK,
                 C = C, post.config.cutoff = 0.05)
samptreethin = post[[1]]   # list of all post-burnin and thinning trees
samptreethin.lik = post[[2]]   # likelihoods of trees in samptree
config = post[[3]] # configuration for each posterior tree
config.summary = post[[4]] # configuration summary
print(config.summary)
# first column: tree configuration
# second column: posterior configuration probability in the entire tree space
# third column: posterior configuration likelihood in the subtree space
@

\newpage

\subsection*{2.5 Tree output and plotting}

One can then use \verb@Canopy@ to output and plot the most likely tree (i.e., 
tree with the highest posterior likelihood). Mutations, clonal frequencies, and
tree topology, etc., of the tree are obtained from the posterior distributions
of subtree space with trees having the same configuration. In our MDA231 
example, the most likely tree is the tree having configuration 3.


<<Plot>>=
config.i = config.summary[which.max(config.summary[,3]),1]
cat('Configuration', config.i, 'has the highest posterior likelihood!\n')
output.tree = canopy.output(post, config.i, C)
canopy.plottree(output.tree, pdf = FALSE)
@

\begin{center}
\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.7\linewidth}

\section*{3. Try it yourself}
Now try Canopy yourself using the simulated toy dataset below! Note that no
overlapping CNAs are used as input and thus matrix $C$ doesn't need to be
specified.

<<Try, eval = FALSE>>=
data(toy)
projectname = 'toy'
R = toy$R; X = toy$X; WM = toy$WM; Wm = toy$Wm
epsilonM = toy$epsilonM; epsilonm = toy$epsilonm; Y = toy$Y

K = 3:6; numchain = 10
sampchain = canopy.sample(R = R, X = X, WM = WM, Wm = Wm, epsilonM = epsilonM, 
                          epsilonm = epsilonm, C = NULL, Y = Y, K = K, 
                          numchain = numchain, simrun = 50000, writeskip = 200,
                          projectname = projectname, cell.line = FALSE,
                          plot.likelihood = TRUE)
@

There should be only one mode in the posterior tree space, with the most likely
tree shown below.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\setkeys{Gin}{width=0.7\linewidth}
<<label=fig3,fig=TRUE,echo=FALSE,height=6,width=5.9>>=
data(toy)
canopy.plottree(toy$besttree, pdf = FALSE)
